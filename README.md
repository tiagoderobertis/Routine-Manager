<h1 align="center">Routine Manager</h1>
<p>This project started with the goal of making it easier to have a register of your gym training, so it would help you not to lose motivation and erasing the need to think too much to go to the gym.</p>
<p>I put a lot of effort on this project, but I decided not to continue with it. However, it helped me to learn a lot of new things.</p>
